## INTRODUCTION

It's not just that we as people take on debt to pay for our needs. A **nation** may also borrow money to run its economy. For instance, one expensive component necessary for a nation's population to live pleasant lifestyles is infrastructure spending. We will examine data on global debt gathered by Kaggle on individual loan pattern.

## Problem Statment

We will examine data on global debt gathered by Kaggle in this project. The dataset includes data on the total amount of debt (in US dollars) owing by individuals in several categories. We'll discover the responses to inquiries like:

1. How much debt does each of this individual represented in the dataset have overall?
2. Which individual holds the most debt, and what does that debt look like?
3. What is the average level of debt held by individuals according to various debt indicators?
